- add log method to the logger, it basically puts the current
timestamp at the start of each log. logger->log(int fd, const char *msg) ??
or logger->logerr(const char *msg) and logger->logout(const char *msg) or with a generic callback
- refactor the `utils_putdate` with variadics, maybe use ft_printf??
add this submodule to the project: https://github.com/yigtuyumz/printf if you use ft_printf
- simplify Makefile's (if they can be simplified)
- get rid of common things in logger & utils. find a way!
- refactor the main.c !!!! and start the project ASAP!
