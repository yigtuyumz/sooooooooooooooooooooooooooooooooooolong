- Add a log method to the logger
it should prepend the current timestamp to each log entry.
Consider something like `logger->log(int fd, const char *msg)`
or separate methods such as `logger->logerr(const char *msg)` and `logger->logout(const char *msg)`,
or possibly a generic callback-based approach.
- Refactor `utils_putdate` to use variadic arguments
maybe integrate ft_printf for formatting.
- add this submodule to the project: https://github.com/yigtuyumz/printf
- Simplify the Makefiles (if possible).
- Remove redundant code shared between logger and utils
find a cleaner, unified solution.
- Refactor main.c and get the project started as soon as possible!
